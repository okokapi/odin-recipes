        <h1 class="header">Best Salad Ever</h1>
        <p class="intro">If I could only choose one salad to eat for the rest of my days, this would be it.
            Combining the creamy tang of goat cheese, earthy sweetness of beets, and crunch of walnuts, this salad
            is a medley of textures and tastes, sure to hit the spot during your lunch break. Plus, it's easy
            to make a week's worth ahead for meal prepping.
        </p>
        <p class="details">Quantities of ingredients here are more to personal preference than anything.
            I like larger salads, lots of beets, and very little dressing, so use your best judgement when
            crafting your salad. For this reason, exact mesasurements are not given. <strong>Measure with
                your heart!</strong>
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheader">Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>Salad greens (I prefer spring mix with some arugula thrown in)</li>
                <li>Whole beets, raw, any variety</li>
                <li>Walnuts, either chopped or halved, raw or candied</li>
                <li>Goat cheese (I like the garlic herb flavors, but blueberry or honey taste great too)</li>
                <li>Balsamic vinaigrette</li>
                <li>Optional additions: chicken breast or thigh, croutons, dried cranberries, or anything
                    else you enjoy in your salads
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subheader">Directions</h3>
        <div class="directions">
            <ol>
                <li>Roast the beets using your favorite method. I typically slice into disks, coat with 
                    avocado oil, salt, pepper, and other seasonings, and roast at 350&deg; until I can 
                    easily pierce them with a fork. Once roasted, set aside and allow to cool to room temperature.
                </li>
                <li class="sub-direction">You can also use prepackaged beets in the produce section. These do 
                    not need to be roasted and can be added to the salad as-is, but I still like to throw them 
                    in the oven with some seasonings to give them more flavor.
                </li>
                <li>Assemble the salad by adding the ingredients in whichever quantities you prefer. I slice and 
                    crumble my goat cheese before adding it, but all of the other ingredients require no modifications.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy your quickly-assembled salad!</li>
            </ol>
