        <h1 class="header">Grandma's Biscuits and Gravy</h1>
        <p class="intro">This recipe comes from my grandma, who will wake up early in the morning to make this
            whenever family visits. Admittedly, she cannot make biscuits from scratch, but that's okay. The gravy 
            can be quite temperamental, so practice in getting the correct consistencies is key!
        </p>
        <p class="details">My grandma didn't provide exact quantities for all of the ingredients. Use your best 
            judgement, and remember, you can always add something, but you can't remove it once it's there.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheader">Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb bacon</li>
                <li>Whole milk</li>
                <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>Wondra-flour</li>
                <li>Sausage patties</li>
                <li>Canned or frozen biscuits of your choice</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subheader">Directions</h3>
        <div class="directions">
            <ol>
                <li>Bake biscuits according to directions.</li>
                <li>In a cast iron pan over low heat, begin to cook the bacon. Be sure to cook it low and slow
                    in order to render the fat.
                </li>
                <li>Once bacon is cooked and crispy, remove from pan and turn heat to medium. Add Wondra-flour, starting with 1/4 cup.
                    Whisk into the bacon grease and allow to brown. This step is key; the flour should be a nutty
                    brown color before moving on to the next step.
                </li>
                <li>Whisk in condensed and whole milk and bring to simmer, stirring the whole time. Cook gravy 
                    until it has reached desired consistency. Remember that the gravy will thicken as it cools, so 
                    don't cook it too much.
                </li>
                <li>Season gravy with salt and a liberal amount of pepper. Be sparing with the salt since bacon
                    grease is already quite salty.
                </li>
                <li>Brown sausage patties until cooked to your liking.</li>
                <li>Assemble your dish! I like to split biscuits in half and top with crumbled sausage and gravy.</li>
            </ol>
